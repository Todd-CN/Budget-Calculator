1. What is Svelte?

Svelte is a small and fast JS framework. 
Svelte compiles our code before we ship it

Unlike traditional frameworks which do the work in the browswer,
Svelte compiles that happens when we build an app

Svelte shines it its simplicity. You end up writing less code
compared to other frameworks. You end up writing straight-up vanilla
JS

2. How we can render lists in Svelte (Each blocks)

For now, let's set up a dummy list in our App.svelte (fruits)

In svelte, we use {#each...} {/each}

For example, {#each fruits as fruit}...our logic...{/each}

{#each fruits as fruit}
whatever logic we place here will be implemented for each fruit in the fruits array, or each item in any given array
{/each}

If we want to access the value of each fruit/item in the array, we can again use the curly braces {} because Svelte allows us to do that

Example: <h1> fruit: {fruit} </h1>
